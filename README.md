### Lesson 4 - Add services
Even though this lesson is about services, I've decided to improve the visual of things a bit

### Lesson 3 - Create a feature component
This lesson just separates components, so no visual difference. Heroes component was divided into Heroes and HeroDetail

### Lesson 2 - Display a List
In this lesson I already implemented Bootstrap to help with the responsive design, and instead of using a list I opted for using a select, since I find it more pleasing.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
